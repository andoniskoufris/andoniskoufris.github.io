            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>I am currently in my fifth year at the University of Queensland, in my Honours year in the Bachelor of Advanced Science with a major in Physics. I have an interest in theoretical physics and am doing my Honours project with Dr. Benjamin Roberts in theoretical atomic physics. I have also been a tutor at the University of Queensland for over two years now and have found it almost as equally challenging and enjoyable as my degree itself!</p>
            
            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p>My Honours project looks at including relativistic effects into high-accuracy theoretical atomic structure calculations. More specifically, I have been looking at including relativistic corrections to the typical electron-electron interaction, the leading order correction to which is known as the Breit interaction, into a high accuracy method for calculating the properties of atoms that uses Feynman diagrams known as the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0375-9601(88)90302-7">all-orders correlation potential method</a>. My Honours thesis can be found <a href="files/Honours_thesis.pdf">here</a>, and we are currently preparing a paper based on the work I completed in my project. More information can be found on the <a href="pages/research.html">research</a> tab on my website.</p>
