            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p>Here is a collection of some of the research I’ve done over the past few years, both as part of my Honours degree and for other research projects throughout my time at University.</p>
            
            <h2>The Breit interaction</h2>
            <p>I completed my Honours thesis under the supervision of Dr. Benjamin Roberts in 2024/2025 on the Breit interaction in atomic physics. The Breit interaction represents the leading order relativistic correction to the typical electron-electron (Coulomb) interaction, and in my project I included it into all-orders perturbative methods in atomic physics. In my thesis I also included frequency-dependent corrections to the Breit interaction into the Hartree-Fock procedure, which hadn’t been done before. Below are a list of resources related to my Honours project: 
            <ul>
                <li><a href="../files/Honours_thesis.pdf">Honours thesis</a></li>
                <li><a href="../files/Honours_talk.pdf">Honours presentation</a></li>
                <li><a href="../files/Skoufris_poster.pdf">Poster</a> made for the 2025 Quantum Year National Tour</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Edge modes in vortex matter of superfluids</h2>
            <p>Over the summer of 2023/2024, I completed a summer research project under the supervision of Dr. Matthew Reeves and Professor Matthew Davis in Bose-Einstein condensation. The aim of my project was to try to numerically reproduce the solitonic modes on the edges of bulk superfluid vortex matter <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.214505">predicted by Bogatskiy and Wiegmann</a>. While I never managed to convincingly find them through numerical simulations, I learnt a lot of interesting physics along the way and made a <a href="../files/2024_summer_research_presentation.pdf">presentation</a> of what I had achieved along the way!</p>

            <h2>Course notes</h2>
            <p>Over the course of my studies I have started a whole bunch of sets of notes for courses that I have taken. Unfortunately most of these have not been finished, but I have attached them below, and hopefully their being available for anyone to see online will force me to finish them someday. That is to say, <strong>none of these notes are finished</strong> and they should not be used with any sort of expectation that they are correct.

                <li><a href="../files/PHYS2941_notes.pdf">Quantum mechanics notes</a></li>
                <li>Atomic physics notes (these do not contain any disussion of angular momentum, but just cover the general theory)</li>
                <li>Classical field theory notes, with an intention to eventually include quantum field theory</li>
            </ul>
